# Voiceflow API Node.js Example

Set up your Voiceflow project with Node.js in a matter of minutes.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
This example can be adapted to run as an HTTP server.

This example lets you chat with your project via the terminal.

## Documentation

## Setup

1. If you do not have node, install _Node.js_ and _npm_ from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), or follow an equivalent guide.
2. In this folder, run `npm install`.
3. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` in `index.js` with your Dialog Manager API Key. You can find it under the integrations tab:

## Example

What it might look like in action:

```
$ npm start

> What is your name?: tyler
what can I do for you?
...
> Say something: send email
who is the recipient?
...
> Say something: tyler@voiceflow.com
what is the title of your email?
...
> Say something: How was your day?
sending the email for tyler@voiceflow.com called "How was your day?". Is that correct?
...
> Say something: yes
successfully sent the email for tyler@voiceflow.com called "How was your day?"
The end! Start me again with `npm start`
```

# Voiceflow API HTML Example
Set up your Voiceflow project on a webpage in a matter of minutes. This example is not meant to be run in production.

> ⚠️ - It is not recommended to allow anyone to see your API Key, keep this a secret and implement it on the backend instead. Voiceflow may create public keys in the future.

## Setup
1. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` and `'YOUR_VERSION_ID_HERE'` in `index.html` with your API Key and Voiceflow project version ID. You can find them under the integrations tab: ![Screen Shot 2021-08-13 at 6 00 07 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5643574/129422436-04d964d3-85a0-402d-ae5e-d6e84723da5e.png)
2. open `index.html` on any browser to start your chat!
